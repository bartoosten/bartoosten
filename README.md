### Hi There 👋

I’m currently working on IOT solutions for Home Security Systems and Healthcare. To develop these solutions I use React and NEXT (SSR). Furthermore I also develop Mobile Applications with tools like React Native & Expo. I’m currently learning CI/CD with Azure Devops, Circle CI & Fastlane.

I’m looking to collaborate on projects and ideas that would help people be more connected and makes their life easier. I tend to challenge the core situation and solutions in a positive way, not only technical but also conceptual.

Ask me about, job oppertunities, virtual reality, AI, personal, political, economic, aesthetic, psychological, moral, ethical, and social consequences of technology.

- ⚡ Fun fact 1: As a kid I couldn't sit still, now I crave Meditation and Mindfullness
- ⚡ Fun fact 2: I have a dog named Sushi
- ⚡ Fun fact 3: I'm currently saving up for a Telescope to photograph nearby planets in our universe 🌌
