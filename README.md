### Hello World 🌍

- 🔭 I’m currently working on IOT solutions for Home Security Systems and Healthcare. To develop these solutions I use React and NEXT (SSR). Furthermore I also develop Mobile Applications with tools like React Native & Expo.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CI/CD with Azure Devops, Circle CI & Fastlane.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects and ideas that would help people be more connected and makes their life easier. I tend to challenge the core situation and solutions in a positive way, not only technical but also conceptual.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with better understanding complex backend solutions, like Design Patterns in C#; With the purpose of getting a more complete picture of the technical landscape.
- 💬 Ask me about, job oppertunities, virtual reality, AI, personal, political, economic, aesthetic, psychological, moral, ethical, and social consequences of technology.
